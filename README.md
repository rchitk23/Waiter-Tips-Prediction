# Waiter Tips Prediction

This project predicts the tips given to waiters based on various features such as total bill, gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size. The predictions are made using a Linear Regression model.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing waiter tips data and building a machine learning model to predict tips based on various features. We use Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, plotly, and scikit-learn to perform data analysis, visualization, and model training.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "tips" dataset, which includes the following features:
- `total_bill`: The total bill amount (in dollars).
- `tip`: The tip amount (in dollars).
- `sex`: Gender of the person paying the bill.
- `smoker`: Whether there were smokers in the party.
- `day`: Day of the week.
- `time`: Time of day (Lunch/Dinner).
- `size`: Size of the party.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the environment and run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waiter-tips-prediction.git
   cd waiter-tips-prediction
